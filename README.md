## Overview

This is a Go library that implements a Sparse Merkle Trie for a key-value map.
The trie implements the same optimisations specified in the [Libra whitepaper],
to reduce the number of hash operations required per trie operation to $O(k)$
where $k$ is the number of non-empty elements in the trie. And is implemented
in a similar way to the [JMT whitepaper], with additional features and proof
mechanics.

## Documentation

Documentation for the different aspects of this library can be found in the
[docs](./docs/) directory.

## Tests

To run all the unit tests in the repo (excluding fuzz tests and benchmarks)
simply run the following command:

```sh
make test_all
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks for the different aspects of this SMT library can be found in
[benchmarks](./benchmarks/). In order to run the entire benchmarking suite use
the following command:

```sh
make benchmark_all
```

### Definitions

Below is a list of terms used in the benchmarks' results that may need
clarification.

#### Bytes/Operation (B/op)

- This refers to the number of bytes allocated for each operation.

#### Commit

- The `Commit` term refers to the `Commit` method of the trie. This takes all
  changes (which are made in memory) to the trie and writes them to the
  underlying database.

#### Sizing

- The tests use the following sizes: 0.1M, 0.5M, 1M, 5M, 10M. The `M` refers to
  millions hence:
  - 0.1M = 100,000 (One hundred thousand)
  - 0.5M = 500,000 (Five hundred thousand)
  - 1M = 1,000,000 (One million)
  - 5M = 5,000,000 (Five million)
  - 10M = 10,000,000 (Ten million)
- These sizes refer to the number of key-value pairs or key-value-sum triples
  inserted into the trie either beforehand or during the benchmark depending on
  which benchmark it is.

_NOTE: Unless otherwise stated the benchmarks in this document were ran on a
2023 14-inch Macbook Pro M2 Max with 32GB of RAM. The tries tested are using the
`sha256.New()` hasher._

_TODO: There is an opportunity to do a fuzz test where we commit every `N`
updates, if this ever becomes a bottlneck_

### SMT

In order to run the SMT benchmarks use the following command:

```sh
make benchmark_smt
```

#### Fill

The "fill" benchmarks cover the time taken to insert `N` key-value pairs into
the SMT, as well as how long it takes to do this and commit these changes to
disk. This gives us an insight into how long it takes to build a trie of a
certain size.

In order to run the SMT filling benchmarks use the following command:

```sh
make benchmark_smt_fill
```

#### Operations

The "operations" benchmarks cover the time taken to perform a single operation
on an SMT of a given size, and also how long doing this operation followed by a
commit would take. This gives us insight into how the SMT operates when filled
to differing degrees.

In order to run the SMT operation benchmarks use the following command:

```sh
make benchmark_smt_ops
```

### Proofs

To run the tests to average the proof size for numerous prefilled tries use the
following command:

```sh
make benchmark_proof_sizes
```
